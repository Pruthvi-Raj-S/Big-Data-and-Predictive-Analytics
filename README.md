# Big-Data-and-Predictive-Analytics
Introduction to various stages of a data sciences project such as how to answer questions about data, how to visualize data, and how to build predictive models using data that can make new predictions.

## Problem Statement
create a classification model that can predict whether a patient will readmit to the hospital within 30 days using 130 US hospitals diabetes dataset. This dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes,who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The dataset has 47 features and 101766 instances.

## Objective
Using the given dataset, the goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within
30 days of discharge. You will use appropriate performance metrics to evaluate the
performance of your model. The data is not clean, and you will have to apply appropriate
methods to clean the data. Additionally, using unsupervised clustering, you will have to
implement cluster-based classification model that may improve the performance of the
model.
