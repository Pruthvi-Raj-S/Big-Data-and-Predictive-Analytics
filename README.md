## Project Overview

This project utilizes predictive analytics techniques to analyze medical data, specifically focusing on a diabetes dataset. The main goals are:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Building machine learning models to predict outcomes.
- Evaluating model performance.

The project is implemented using Python, and Jupyter notebooks are provided for exploration, model development, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **`Problem_statement/`**: Contains the problem statement and detailed description of the project goals.
- **`diabetic_data.csv`**: The primary dataset used for analysis in this project.
- **`IDS_mapping.csv`**: Mapping of IDs used within the dataset.
- **`GroupX_solutions.ipynb`**: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the solutions, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive model building.
- **`Extra.ipynb`**: Additional exploration or extra analysis that complements the main work.
- **`Report/`**: Contains the report that documents the project findings and conclusions.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**:
    - Ensure the `diabetic_data.csv` file is in the project directory. This file is the primary dataset used for predictive modeling.

2. **Run the Jupyter notebooks**:
    - Open the `GroupX_solutions.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    - The notebook includes the full pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Follow the cells step by step to reproduce the results.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook GroupX_solutions.ipynb
    ```

3. **Explore additional analysis**:
    - The `Extra.ipynb` notebook contains supplementary analysis that complements the main notebook. Feel free to explore it for deeper insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the `diabetic_data.csv` file, which contains various attributes related to patients with diabetes. The goal is to analyze the data to predict potential outcomes and improve the understanding of diabetic conditions through predictive analytics.

## Notebooks

- **`GroupX_solutions.ipynb`**: Main notebook containing the complete workflow for predictive analysis. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`Extra.ipynb`**: Additional notebook with extra exploratory data analysis or model testing.
